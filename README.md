Utilization of some basic algorithms for the recogniton of one of the Iris plants among the three existing (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using Python Language .

Next , these are the algorithms that I used for the recognition of the plants :

    Nearest Neighbor
    Nearest Centroid
    Algorithms above with Data Normalization
